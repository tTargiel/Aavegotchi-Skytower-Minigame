# Aavegotchi-Skytower-Minigame

This repository was created as Aavegotchi Gaame Jaam submission. 
My team (PeculiarCrew) decided to use Phaser 3 as an JavaScript Game Library, Moralis as an Web3 technology layer and what's the most important - we used some magic to fetch SVG from Aavegotchi blockchain :D
